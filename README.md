# clr-Centered-log-ratio-transform-on-R

This code was developed in this paper: Sadeghi and Cohen, 2020: Category-based fractal modelling: A novel model to integrate the geology into the data for more effective processing and interpretation.

This code was provided to apply centered log-ratio (clr) transformation to geochemical data. To do so, the code was modified, from Nazarpour et al., 2015, for clr-transformation using R package robCompositions.
