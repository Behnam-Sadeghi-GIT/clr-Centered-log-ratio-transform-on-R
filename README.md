# clr-Centered-log-ratio-transform-on-R

This code was developed in Sadeghi B (2020) Quantification of Uncertainty in Geochemical Anomalies in Mineral Exploration. PhD thesis, University of New South Wales.

This code was provided to apply centered log-ratio (clr) transformation to geochemical data. To do so, the code was modified, from Nazarpour et al., 2015, for clr-transformation using R package robCompositions.
